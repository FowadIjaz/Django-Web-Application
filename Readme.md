# Project Goal

I like to keep track of movies, TV shows, and books I have watched and read. Initially all I kept track of was the name of the piece of media and whether I would recommend it (Y/N). It has gradually expanded to include keeping track of when I completed it, the year it was published, a rating out of 10, a short review, and a synopsis. 

I dislike keeping track of this information in excel because I prefer to be able to enter data without having to fire up at excel on my desktop, so I decided to create a web application to improve the data entry experience. 

The web application will not only allow me to add to the database, but will also be able to serve up views filtering by medium (book, movie, tv show), genre (comedy, horror, sci fi), and status (completed, abandoned, recommended). Ideally it will also contain some sort of analytics page so that I can view at a glance how many movies, tv shows or books I have seen or read in the recent past. 

As time has gone on and I have started adding more variables to keep track of, the web app should also have the ability to create new columns in the database and have them link back to the model without having to touch the backend code. 

Another nice-to-have would be the ability to pre-fill some of the metadata by searching the internet. For example, I saw the Titanic but don't want to look up its runtime or the year it was made, so being able to autopopulate that information would be ideal.
